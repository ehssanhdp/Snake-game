# Snake-game
Classic Snake Game: A nostalgic, pixelated challenge where players navigate a growing serpent to consume food while avoiding self-collisions and boundary pitfalls.

Snake Game using Tkinter
Description:
This Python script implements a simple Snake game using the Tkinter library and OOP methodes. The game features a snake that the player controls to eat food and grow longer. The player must avoid collisions with the screen edges and the snake's own body. The game ends when a collision occurs.

Features:
Snake movement controlled by arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).
Score displayed on the window.
Snake grows longer and scores points when it eats the food.
Game over screen displayed when a collision occurs.
Random placement of food on the canvas.

How to Run:
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in the terminal.
Run the script using the command: python snake_game.py

Controls:
Left Arrow: Move the snake left.
Right Arrow: Move the snake right.
Up Arrow: Move the snake up.
Down Arrow: Move the snake down.

Game Rules:
The snake moves continuously in the current direction.
Eating food increases the score, and the snake grows longer.
The game ends if the snake collides with the screen edges or itself.

Additional Notes
The game window is not resizable to maintain a fixed size for a better gaming experience.
The snake and food are represented by colored rectangles and ovals, respectively.
The game runs at a fixed speed, with the snake moving one square every 100 milliseconds.
